Fleet Manager Application - FrontEnd 

1. In order to get this to work you need to start up the Fleet Manager Application - BackEnd first (see: [https://github.com/LorenzoVDH/FMA-BackEnd] )

2. Install all the node_modules using npm install 

3. Then just use npm start or ng serve to start the application. 

While it's still a bit rough around the edges, I can say that, thanks to this project, I have learned a lot about Angular/EFCore/N-Tier architecture and creating a Fleet Managing Application in general.
